## Using the WebUI
The WebUI works like any other chatbot interface. You can type in your prompts and see the responses generated by the model.

Below, there is a search bar labeled "How can I help you today?" with a microphone and audio icon to the right. Suggested prompts include "Tell me a fun fact about the Roman Empire," "Show me a code snippet of a website's sticky header," and "Give me ideas for what to do with my kids' art." On the left side, there is a menu with options for "Workspace," "Search," and "Chats." A circular profile icon labeled "M" is in the top right corner.](images/webUI.png)
