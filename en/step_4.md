## Using the WebUI
The WebUI works like any other chatbot interface. You can type in your prompts and see the responses generated by the model.

The left sidebar includes options for "New Chat," "Workspace," and "Search." The top right corner shows a circular user icon with "MC" initials.](images/webUI.png)
