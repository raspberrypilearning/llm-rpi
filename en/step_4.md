## Using the WebUI
The WebUI works like any other chatbot interface. You can type in your prompts and see the responses generated by the model.

There are four suggested prompts below: "Grammar check," "Show me a code snippet," "Give me ideas," and part of another prompt. The left sidebar includes options for "New Chat," "Workspace," and "Search." The top right corner shows a circular user icon with "MC" initials.](images/webUI.png)
