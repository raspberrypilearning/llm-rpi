## Pull and Run a Model for Your Ollama Instance
In simple terms, "pulling a model" means downloading a specific AI model that Ollama will use to perform tasks. 

There are various models available at [ollama.com/library](https://ollama.com/library){:target="_blank"}. We recommend starting with `gemma:2b`, `phi`, or `tinyllama`. Be cautious with models larger than 5 billion parameters, as they might be too demanding for a standard Raspberry Pi.

Run the following command, replacing `[model name here]` with the name of the model you want to use:

```sh
ollama run [model name here]
```
You will see some progress bars fill up and then be asked to prompt the model.

Interact with the model by asking it questions, requesting it to write a poem or story, or simply having a chat.

Press `Ctrl + D` to exit the LLM prompting process when you are done.

### Using the WebUI
The WebUI works like any other chatbot interface. You can type in your prompts and see the responses generated by the model.

There are four suggested prompts below: "Grammar check," "Show me a code snippet," "Give me ideas," and part of another prompt. The left sidebar includes options for "New Chat," "Workspace," and "Search." The top right corner shows a circular user icon with "MC" initials.](images/webUI.png)

Access the WebUI interface by navigating to `http://localhost:8080/` in your web browser.

Choose which model to use from the dropdown menu at the top of the WebUI. You can also search for and add new models this way.
