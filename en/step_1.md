[Ollama](https://ollama.com){:target="_blank"} is an open-source tool designed to run large language models (LLMs) on your Raspberry pi itself, rather than over the internet.

By following these steps, you will transform your Raspberry Pi into a powerful AI assistant using Ollama. You will install Ollama along with its WebUI interface, pull a suitable AI model, and interact with it to perform various tasks such as answering questions, generating text, or engaging in conversation. 

This setup will enable you to explore and use advanced generative AI capabilities directly from your Raspberry Pi.

### You will need:
- A Raspberry Pi 4 or 5 with a micro SD card of **at least** 32Gb storage.
- Access to an internet connection for the Raspberry Pi.

If you are under 13 years old, we want to make sure you understand the importance of keeping your personal information safe. The Raspberry Pi Foundation is committed to protecting your data, and we take your privacy very seriously.
When you work on generative AI projects using a Raspberry Pi, it's important to know that by installing the software, your personal data will never leave your computer. All of the AI processing happens right on your Raspberry Pi, so your information stays safe and secure with you.

You might notice that many online services require users to be at least 13 years old. This is because they process and store the data you enter into their models, which can include personal information. These services follow strict rules to protect your data, but because the information is sent over the internet, it can sometimes be less secure.

With the Raspberry Pi, everything stays on your own device, so you don't have to worry about your data being processed elsewhere. This way, you can explore and learn about AI safely and confidently. If you have any questions or need help, please ask a parent, guardian, or teacher to guide you through the process.

Secondly, it's also important to be aware that generative AI can sometimes produce content that is biased, inaccurate, or misleading. These AI models can "hallucinate" by confidently generating information that isn't factual or reliable. This means that not everything an AI tool produces should be taken at face value, and itâ€™s essential to critically evaluate the output. As you work with generative AI, remember to verify the information and consult trusted sources to ensure accuracy. Always approach AI-generated content with a healthy level of skepticism and a critical mind.

Enjoy learning and creating with Generative AI!
