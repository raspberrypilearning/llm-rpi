[Ollama](https://ollama.com){:target="_blank"} is an open-source tool designed to run large language models (LLMs) on your Raspberry pi itself, rather than over the internet.

By following these steps, you will transform your Raspberry Pi into a powerful AI assistant using Ollama. You will install Ollama along with its WebUI interface, pull a suitable AI model, and interact with it to perform various tasks such as answering questions, generating text, or engaging in conversation. 

This setup will enable you to explore and use advanced generative AI capabilities directly from your Raspberry Pi.

### You will need:
- A Raspberry Pi 4 or 5 with a micro SD card of **at least** 32Gb storage.
- Access to an internet connection for the Raspberry Pi.
