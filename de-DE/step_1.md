## Das wirst du machen

![The image shows the interface of a language model or AI assistant named "llava." At the top, the interface greets the user, "Hello, MrC," and asks, "How can I help you today?" Below the greeting, there are several suggested prompt options for interacting with the AI. At the bottom of the interface, there is a text box to "Send a Message" and microphone and help icons in the lower right corner. The layout is simple and minimalistic with a clean design.](images/wywm.png)

[Ollama](https://ollama.com){:target="_blank"} is an open-source tool designed to run large language models (LLMs) on your Raspberry Pi itself, rather than over the internet.

By following these steps, you will transform your Raspberry Pi into a powerful AI assistant using Ollama. You will install Ollama along with its WebUI interface, pull a suitable AI model, and interact with it to perform various tasks such as answering questions, helping you write a story, or providing support.

This setup will enable you to explore and use advanced generative AI capabilities directly from your Raspberry Pi.

### Benötigtes Material:

- A Raspberry Pi 4 or 5 with a micro SD card of **at least** 32GB storage
- An internet connection for the Raspberry Pi

## title:  Why do we recommend older learners use this project?

It's important to understand how you can keep your personal information safe. The Raspberry Pi Foundation is very careful about protecting your data and your privacy, which is why we only recommend this project if you're over 13 years old.

You might have noticed that many online services ask users to be at least 13 years old. This is because they handle and store data you provide, which can include personal information. Although these services follow strict rules to protect your data, sending information over the internet can sometimes be less secure.

When you use generative AI tools on a Raspberry Pi, all of the work happens right on your device. **Your personal data stays on your computer and never leaves it.** This keeps your information safe and secure and lets you explore and learn about AI safely.

But it's also important to know that generative AI can sometimes create **content that isn’t accurate, fair, or appropriate**. These AI models can sometimes "hallucinate" and **produce information that sounds true but isn’t**. So, it’s important to **think carefully about the AI application’s output and double-check it**. As you work with generative AI, make sure to check the information and ask trusted sources if you’re unsure.

**Always look at AI-generated content with a careful and thoughtful mind.** If you need help, please ask a parent, guardian, or teacher to guide you.

Enjoy learning and creating with generative AI!
